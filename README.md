# 📖 Project Overview

GymSync-CLI is a command-line automation framework built with **Python** and **Selenium WebDriver** that provides a modern approach to automating browser-based gym schedule management.

Unlike traditional automation tools that rely on visible GUI interactions, GymSync-CLI treats the browser as a programmable runtime. It communicates directly with the active browser session, injects JavaScript, synchronizes DOM elements, manipulates LocalStorage, and performs complex scheduling tasks with minimal user interaction.

The framework was designed around four primary goals:

## ⚡ Performance

Avoid unnecessary GUI operations and reduce repetitive manual interactions by automating the complete workflow directly from the terminal.

---

## 🛡️ Reliability

Maintain isolated browser profiles, structured exception handling, and controlled runtime behavior to ensure stable automation sessions.

---

## 🧩 Modularity

Every subsystem is designed to be extendable. Developers can customize mappings, workflows, scheduling logic, browser behavior, and future integrations without rewriting the entire application.

---

## 🌍 Open Source

GymSync-CLI is fully open-source and intended for learning, customization, experimentation, and community contributions.

Whether you're exploring Selenium, browser automation, or command-line application architecture, the project serves as both a practical utility and a learning resource.

---

> **Status:** ✅ Active Development Complete  
> **Current Release:** Stable  
> **Language:** Python  
> **Interface:** Command Line (CLI)  
> **Automation Engine:** Selenium WebDriver  
> **Browser:** Google Chrome  
> **License:** MIT

# 🔥 Core Features

GymSync-CLI is built around a modular automation engine where every component performs a dedicated task. Together they create a fast, reliable, and developer-friendly browser automation framework.

---

## ⚡ Direct LocalStorage Injection

Instead of manually interacting with dozens of webpage elements, GymSync-CLI injects serialized schedule data directly into the browser's LocalStorage.

### Benefits

- 🚀 Extremely fast updates
- 📦 No temporary files
- ⚡ Instant browser synchronization
- 🔄 Real-time application state updates

---

## 🌐 Live DOM Synchronization

Once data is injected, the framework immediately executes JavaScript routines that refresh and synchronize the active webpage.

This ensures every UI component reflects the newest information without requiring manual page interaction.

### Advantages

- Instant UI updates
- Reduced user interaction
- Better responsiveness
- Cleaner automation flow

---

## 🔒 Isolated Chrome Profiles

Every automation session runs inside its own dedicated Chrome profile.

```
chrome_profile/
```

Benefits include:

- Separate login sessions
- Persistent cookies
- Saved preferences
- Safe testing environment
- No interference with your personal Chrome profile

---

## 🧠 Intelligent Account Management

GymSync-CLI continuously monitors browser state during authentication.

If an account:

- doesn't exist
- expires
- logs out
- encounters validation errors

the framework intelligently pauses execution and allows the user to:

- Register
- Retry Login
- Exit Safely

instead of crashing.

---

## 🛡️ Zero Traceback Protection

Unexpected exceptions can clutter terminals with long Python tracebacks.

GymSync-CLI implements custom exception handling that keeps terminal output clean while preventing unnecessary information from appearing.

Benefits:

- Cleaner logs
- Better user experience
- Easier debugging
- Professional terminal appearance

---

## ⌨️ Smart Keyboard Controls

Instead of immediately terminating execution,

GymSync-CLI uses a controlled interrupt system.

Example:

```
Press Ctrl+C once
↓

Confirmation Requested

↓

Press Ctrl+C again

↓

Application exits safely
```

This prevents accidental termination.

---

## 📅 Dynamic Schedule Engine

Supports complete weekly scheduling.

Features include:

- Multiple exercise categories
- Custom time slots
- Weekly planning
- Flexible schedule mapping
- Expandable configuration

---

## ⚙️ Browser Automation Engine

Powered by Selenium WebDriver.

Capabilities include:

- Login automation
- Form interaction
- Button clicking
- JavaScript execution
- Data extraction
- Dynamic page updates

---

## 📊 Interactive Terminal Dashboard

Instead of dozens of command-line arguments,

GymSync-CLI provides an interactive dashboard.

```
===============================
 GYM AUTOMATION DASHBOARD
===============================

1. Book Classes

2. Update Schedule

3. Delete Schedule

4. Diagnostics

5. Settings

6. Exit

===============================
```

This makes the framework beginner friendly while remaining powerful.

---

## 📝 Clean Console Logging

Every operation is logged using structured terminal messages.

Example

```
[INFO] Initializing Chrome...

[SUCCESS] Login Successful

[INFO] Injecting Schedule...

[SUCCESS] Synchronization Complete

[WARNING] Sunday already exists.

[ERROR] Session Expired.
```

Readable logs make debugging significantly easier.

---

## 🚀 Performance Focused

The framework was designed around speed.

Instead of repeatedly clicking webpage elements,

it performs direct browser operations whenever possible.

Result:

- Lower execution time
- Lower CPU usage
- Reduced unnecessary browser activity

---

# 🔒 Security

Security is an important design principle of GymSync-CLI.

The framework avoids unnecessary data exposure while keeping browser automation isolated from the user's personal browsing environment.

---

## Local Profile Isolation

Every browser session runs inside an isolated Chrome profile.

Benefits include:

- Independent cookies
- Separate login sessions
- Protected browser preferences
- Safe testing environment

---

## No Cloud Storage

GymSync-CLI does **not** upload schedule data to external cloud services.

All runtime information remains on the user's machine.

---

## Session Protection

The framework continuously validates browser sessions before executing automation commands.

If an invalid session is detected, execution pauses instead of continuing with corrupted data.

---

## Safe Shutdown

Before closing the application GymSync-CLI performs:

- Browser cleanup
- Session cleanup
- Resource cleanup
- Driver termination

This prevents orphan browser processes.

---

## Error Isolation

Unexpected exceptions are handled gracefully.

Instead of exposing long Python tracebacks, the framework presents clean and readable messages whenever possible.

---
